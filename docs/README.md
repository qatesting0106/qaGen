## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive framework for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using various metrics and visualizations. It provides tools for document processing, question generation, answer generation, and evaluation of both performance and security aspects of the generated answers.

The system integrates with Mistral AI and Groq for embeddings and language model capabilities, and implements OWASP LLM security guidelines for comprehensive security assessment.

## Key Features

- Document processing and chunking
- Question generation from documents
- Answer generation using RAG
- Comprehensive metrics evaluation
- Security assessment based on OWASP LLM guidelines
- Interactive dashboard visualization
- Results export in JSON and HTML formats
